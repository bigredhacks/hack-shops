## Making a Cornell Popularity API with Node.js and Mongoose

In this workshop, you're going to learn how to create an API using Node.js, express, and Mongoose.  We'll be making the back-end for a popularity site that lets you find out how popular you are by your netid!

## Prerequisites
You're going to need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), [git bash](https://git-scm.com/), and [Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US) (or equivalent).

* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that will act as our server.
* MongoDB is a schemaless, key-value database.
* Git is an industry standard distributed version control system.
* ARC (Advanced Rest Client) is a convenient chrome extension for making calls to your API

## The Server
All of the code for this is available within this repository. We will be talking a lot about it in 


## Running Locally

Save your work and type node index.js in your terminal. Then open your browser to 

    http://localhost:3000/popularity/shb95
    
You should now see on your terminal that a request has been made! And your browser should show the contents of the request!

## ???/Profit

So after all of that, you do in fact have a server that will increment numbers based on the amount of times you make post requests. It's not a lot, but it's a start.

One thing we have not covered in this is deploying your server to the web. There are plenty of services for this including OpenShift, Heroku, AWS, Azure, and GCE, and they have very user-friendly guides for getting your Node.Js code onto their platforms.

Hopefully, this has given you enough to work on something you're truly excited about at BigRed//Hacks!
