## Making a Cornell Popularity API with Node.js and Mongoose

In this workshop, you're going to learn how to create and host an API using Node.js, express, and Mongoose.  We'll host the API using a free
site called OpenShift.
We'll be making the back-end for a popularity site that lets you find out how popular you are by your netid!

## Prerequisites
You're going to need Node.js, MongoDB, git bash, and an OpenShift account.

## The Server
All of the code for this is available within this repository under the popularity_api folder.

Assuming you have set up Node.js and gotten mongo running, it is time to create the app.

In a terminal within the folder in which you want to create your app, type

    npm init

and follow the instructions to create your package.json file.

We're going to need the express and mongoose modules in order to easily deliver content and store data.  Execute the following command:

    npm install express mongoose --save

Now we're ready to start coding.

Open/Create index.js with your favorite text editor (we use WebStorm in BigRed//Hacks, but feel free to use vim.. or something else?)
